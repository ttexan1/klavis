## Option 1: Copy-paste llms.txt

Copy the [<u>llms.txt</u>](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Klavis-AI/klavis/refs/heads/main/LLM.md) and paste it in the prompt for your coding assistant.



## Option 2: Install the MCP server

Open a terminal and run the following command to install the MCP server locally:

```bash
