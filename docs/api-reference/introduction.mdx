## Base URL

The Klavis API is built on REST principles. We enforce HTTPS in every request to improve data security, integrity, and privacy. The API does not support HTTP.

All requests contain the following base URL:

```bash
https://api.klavis.ai
```

## Authentication

To authenticate you need to add an Authorization header with the contents of the header being Bearer key_123456789 where key_123456789 is your API Key.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer key_123456789
```

## Response codes

Klavis uses standard HTTP codes to indicate the success or failure of your requests.

In general, 2xx HTTP codes correspond to success, 4xx codes are for user-related failures, and 5xx codes are for infrastructure issues.

| Status | Description                             |
| ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 200    | Successful request.                     |
| 400    | Check that the parameters were correct. |
| 401    | The API key used was missing.           |
| 403    | The API key used was invalid.           |
| 404    | The resource was not found.             |
| 429    | The rate limit was exceeded.            |
| 5xx    | Indicates an error with Klavis servers. |

Check Error Codes for a comprehensive breakdown of all possible API errors.

## Rate limit

The default maximum rate limit is 2 requests per second. This number can be increased for trusted senders by request. After that, you'll hit the rate limit and receive a 429 response error code.
