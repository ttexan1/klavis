# AI Platform Integrations

Klavis AI seamlessly integrates with leading AI platforms, enabling you to build sophisticated AI agents that can interact with external services and APIs via MCP.

## Available Integrations

## How It Works

The integration pattern is consistent across all AI platforms:

1. **Setup**: Configure your AI platform API key and Klavis API key
2. **MCP Instance**: Create MCP server instances for the services you need (YouTube, Gmail, Slack, etc.)
3. **Agent Creation**: Build an AI agent that discovers available tools from MCP servers
4. **Function Calling**: The AI platform's LLM decides which tools to use based on user requests
5. **Tool Execution**: Tools are executed through Klavis API to remote MCP Servers and results are returned to the LLM
6. **Smart Response**: The LLM generates intelligent responses based on tool results
