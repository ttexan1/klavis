description: "Make your coding assistant access Klavis documentation."
---

Klavis provides LLM-accessible tools (powered by Mintlify) that you can plug locally in your coding assistant (Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, etc.) to speed up your local development. There are two options:
* **An MCP server** that can directly query this documentation, ensuring your coding assistant receives real-time information about available commands and features.
* **An llms-full.txt** text file with the entire documentation compiled and formatted for LLMs

Alternatively you can also use the native AI assistant built into this documentation portal.

## Option 1: Install the MCP server

Open a terminal and run the following command to install the MCP server locally:

```bash
npx mint-mcp add klavisai
```

Everything will be set up automatically.

<Tip>
You can also use the remote MCP server for Klavis documentation at `https://docs.klavis.ai/mcp`. To connect directly from your IDE, update your `mcp.json` like below:

```json
"klavisai": {
  "url": "https://docs.klavis.ai/mcp"
}
```
</Tip>

## Option 2: Copy-paste llms-full.txt

You'll find a `llms-full.txt` file at the root level of this documentation. It is a compiled text document designed to provide context for LLMs. 

Copy the following content and paste it in the prompt for your coding assistant: https://docs.klavis.ai/llms-full.txt

## Option 3: Use the documentation's built-in assistant

This documentation portal has a built-in AI assistant. Simply click "✨**Ask AI**" at the top of any page to use it.
